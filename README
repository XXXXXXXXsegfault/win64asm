Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

All labels start with '@'. For example:
@infinite_loop
jmp @infinite_loop

'@_$CUR' refers to the address of the start of the current instruction. For example:
# infinite loop
jmp @_$CUR

'@_$NEXT' refers to the address of the end of the current instruction. For example:
# RIP-relative addressing
lea @message-@_$NEXT(%rip),%rcx

'@_$DATA' refers to the address of the data segment. For example:
# access the data segment
mov @_$DATA+40-@_$NEXT(%rip),%eax

'@_$IMAGE' refers to the address of the image base. For example:
# obtain the image base
lea @_$IMAGE-@_$NEXT(%rip),%rax
